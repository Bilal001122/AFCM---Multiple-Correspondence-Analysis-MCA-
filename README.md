# AFCM - Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for performing Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), also known as Analyse Factorielle en Composante Multiple (AFCM) in French, using R. MCA is a multivariate statistical technique used to analyze categorical data by exploring relationships among multiple variables simultaneously. This project is part of my school course on **Data analysis**.

## Usage
1. **Importing the Dataset**: Begin by importing your dataset, ensuring to remove non-qualitative (quantitative) columns if necessary.

2. **Generating the Barplot**: Utilize the imported data to create a barplot showing the top 8 modalities in each facet.

3. **Transforming Data into Disjunctive Table**: Transform the dataset into a disjunctive table to perform Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA).

4. **Performing MCA**: Use the prepared data to conduct Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA).

5. **Visualizing Results**: Visualize the results of MCA by generating plots such as eigenvalue diagram, variable and individual contributions, and biplot.

6. **Identifying Key Variables**: Identify the variables best represented by MCA by examining their relative contributions.
